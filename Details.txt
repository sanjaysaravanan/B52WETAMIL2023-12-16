  Error Handling:
    Unknown erros gets thrown by default when we do something wrong,

      assignment to a constant variable
      division by zer0
      changing the array length type
    
    We can manually throw an error when we think something is wrong,
      throw new Error();


  Async/Await:

    avoid chaining of promises, synchronous execution promises

      async --> implies we are carring an async operation inside a function
      await --> waiting for the promise to get resolved
    
    async function returns a promise
